## How to meet the expert

When you are ready, try to speak to the expert. Do not send them too many messages. You can use email, Slack or any other way. 

Be polite. Do not write very long messages. Clearly say what you want to talk about. Say what information you need, and how soon do you need it. Work with the subject matter expert to select a suitable time and place for the meeting. 

While you wait for the expert's reply, you can also try to find documentation that may answer your questions.

If the subject matter expert does not reply, you can try to find another expert who knows what you need to know. Even if this expert does not know everything, they can still be helpful.  

Be patient, but do not stop give up if your expert does not reply. Remember that this meeting is important for your work. If the expert's help is very necessary, you can try to contact their supervisor or manager. Only do this if you have no other choice.   

## Good job

After you meet with the expert, remember to read your notes again. See if they are clear and complete. If they are not clear or complete, ask the expert to explain. Thank the expert for their time.

Always try to have good relations with your experts. This will help you with your own work.

There are many reasons why subject matter experts may not be able to work together with technical writers. 

* Subject matter experts have their own work to do. They may not have time to assist you with your work. 
* Subject matter experts may not know that technical writers need their help. Some experts never worked with technical writers before. Some experts do not understand the importance of this work.
* An illness, a family emergency or other events may cause the subject matter expert to unexpectedly stop responding to your questions.

These things all help with 

Remember - by adequately preparing for the interview, you can maximize the efficiency of the interaction, gather accurate information, and build a strong working relationship with the SME, leading to high-quality technical documentation. 

## Time to reach out

When ready, reach out to the expert through a preferred channel—email, Slack, or another medium. Use multiple channels judiciously to avoid overwhelming the expert.

Be polite and efficient in your communication. <b> Clearly outline the purpose of your interview and the urgency of their input. Communicate specific information needed, project scope, and timelines. </b> Acknowledge their busy schedule; offer flexible communication options and respect their time constraints. Highlight the critical role their expertise plays in meeting deadlines.

While awaiting the SME's response, explore existing documentation or consult knowledgeable colleagues or secondary sources for preliminary information. Who knows - you might find answers to many questions on your own.

If your chosen SME doesn't respond - explore if there are other SMEs or experts within the organization who might be able to provide similar insights or information. While maintaining accuracy is crucial, an alternative source might help fill the gap temporarily. You can also explore publicly available resources or documentation related to the subject matter. While not ideal, these resources might offer insights that partially address your information needs.

Patience is key, but persistence pays off. Remember that you're not asking for a personal favor - this is a crucial part of your job. If the situation persists and impacts the project's progress, consider reaching out to the SME's supervisor or manager. Politely explain the situation and seek their support in facilitating communication or involvement. This should be treated as the nuclear option, however, and will earn you no favor from anyone involved. 

## Mission accomplished

With luck, you should now have an interview scheduled. Afterward, review your notes for clarity and completeness. Seek clarification through follow-up communication if any points remain unclear. Always thank the SME for their time and valuable input!

Building a robust working relationship with the SME leads to high-quality technical documentation. Remember, documentation is a means of knowledge sharing among team members, departments, and organizations—crucial for growth, innovation, and continuous improvement.
